What Is Social Media Management?</h2><br><br>
Social media management is the process of analyzing social media audiences and developing a strategy that’s tailored to them, creating and distributing content for social media profiles, monitoring online conversations, collaborating with influencers, providing community service, and monitoring, measuring, and reporting on social media performance and ROI.<br><br>

All these tasks, which were once marginalized by businesses, have now stepped into the limelight of companies’ marketing strategies.<br><br>

Why? Because social media provides great money-making opportunities – on the condition you manage your social channels in an organized, efficient way.
