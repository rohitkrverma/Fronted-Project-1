<h2>Software Maintainence</h2>
Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes.<br><br>

A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects. However, one study indicated that over 80% of maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions.[2] This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system.[citation needed] More recent studies put the bug-fixing proportion closer to 21%
